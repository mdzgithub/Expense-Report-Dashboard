# Expense Report System Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and components of our expense reporting system. The system generates pseudo expense reports, processes the data, and presents it in a Streamlit application dashboard.

## System Architecture

The expense reporting system consists of the following components:

1. Azure Function (Data Generation)
2. Azure Data Lake Storage
3. Azure Databricks (ELT Processing)
4. Streamlit Application (Data Visualization)

### 1. Azure Function (Data Generation)

- **Repository**: [ExpenseGenFunction](https://github.com/mdzgithub/Azure_Functions/tree/main/ExpenseGenFunction)
- **Purpose**: Generates pseudo expense reports to simulate employee spending data.
- **Output**: Raw expense data

### 2. Azure Data Lake Storage

- **Purpose**: Stores the raw expense data generated by the Azure Function.
- **Data Format**: Likely CSV or JSON files containing expense information.

### 3. Azure Databricks (ELT Processing)

- **Architecture**: Multi-hop architecture
- **Process**:
  1. Extract data from Azure Data Lake Storage
  2. Transform the data as needed
  3. Load the processed data into Delta tables

### 4. Streamlit Application (Data Visualization)

- **Purpose**: Provides a user interface to view and analyze expense data.
- **Data Source**: Connects to the Delta tables in Azure Databricks.
- **Features**: Displays various metrics and allows for data exploration.

## Streamlit Application Dashboard

The Streamlit application presents an Expense Report Dashboard with the following features:

Key components of the dashboard:

1. **Total Expenses**: Displays the sum of all expenses ($1789.70 in the example).
2. **Average Expenses by Employee**: Shows the mean expense amount per employee ($596.57 in the example).
3. **Highest Spender**: Identifies the employee with the highest total expenses (Mary, $852.49 in the example).
4. **Employee Selector**: Allows filtering of data by specific employee or viewing all employees.
5. **Expenses by Category**: A bar chart breaking down expenses into categories (food, supplies, travel).

## Data Flow

1. The Azure Function generates pseudo expense reports.
2. Raw data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage.
3. Azure Databricks performs ELT operations on the raw data.
4. Processed data is stored in Delta tables.
5. The Streamlit application retrieves data from Delta tables and presents it in the dashboard.

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for improvement or expansion:

1. Implement real-time data processing for up-to-date expense reporting.
2. Add more detailed breakdowns of expenses (e.g., by department, project, or time period).
3. Incorporate machine learning models for expense anomaly detection or forecasting.
4. Implement user authentication and role-based access control in the Streamlit application.
